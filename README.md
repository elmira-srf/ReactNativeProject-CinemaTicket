# ReactNativeProject-CinemaTicket
Hi there,
In this project, users can choose from a list of movies and see their detail. If the user is logged in they can also buy a cinema ticket for that movie which will be added to the list of tickets of that user. Each new signed-up user will be added to the firebase. After that, any cinema ticket bought by that user will be saved in that user's Firebase.
Hope you enjoy it.
